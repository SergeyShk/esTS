    Computing the dispersion of words over the parts of a text

    Description:
        The text is split into parts: parts is either the number of parts of
        about equal size or the sizes of the parts in order (sentences,
        paragraphs, chapters), which add up to the number of words. For every
        word its frequencies by part are taken and the measures of dispersion
        of Gries (2008, 2020) computed: DP and normalized DP, Juilland's D,
        Carroll's D2, Rosengren's S and the Kullback-Leibler divergence; Gries
        recommends DP
        Words are compared as they are: case and lemmatization belong to the
        extraction
