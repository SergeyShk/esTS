    Finding the collocations of a sequence of words

    Description:
        Pairs of words are ordered, as in NLTK: the right word occurs no more
        than window words after the left one, and every pair of positions is
        counted once; window = 1 gives bigrams. For a pair the chosen measure of
        association is computed from the frequencies of the words, of the pair
        and the number of words N; the frequency of the pair is divided by the
        size of the window inside the measure (Church and Hanks 1990, as in
        NLTK), so that the expected frequency does not depend on the window and
        Dice and the minimum sensitivity stay at most one, while freq_pair keeps
        the undivided frequency. With window > 1 the scale of the Dice measures
        therefore shifts: a pair always side by side gets a logDice of
        14 − log2(window) (13 at a window of 2, 11.68 at 5) and not 14 as bigrams
        Words are compared as they are: case, lemmatization and stop words
        belong to the extraction
